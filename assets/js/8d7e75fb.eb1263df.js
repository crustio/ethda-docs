Using Ethereum L1 as DA derives security from Ethereum and that's the reason why rollups are widely regarded as the only trustless scaling solution in the medium and long term.

This situation becomes even worse as L2 ecosystem prospers."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The long term and canonical solution to this DA dilemma is Danksharding, and the medium term solution is EIP-4844, or Proto-Danksharding, which the Ethereum community is actively working on as part of the upcoming Cancun-Deneb upgrade. EIP-4844 introduces a new type of Blob TX that rollups could use to post their L2 transaction bundle to L1 in a gas efficient manner.
