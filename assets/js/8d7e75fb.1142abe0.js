Using Ethereum L1 as DA derives security from Ethereum and that's the reason why rollups are widely regarded as the only trustless scaling solution in the medium and long term.

EIP-4844 introduces a new type of Blob TX that rollups could use to post their L2 transaction bundle to L1 in a gas efficient manner.
