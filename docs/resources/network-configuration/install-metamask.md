4. Agree or disagree to privacy policy.

5. Create password.

6. Click *Secure my wallet*. You will be given your backup phrase, also known as your "private key," which is made up of 12 words. It is good practice to write this down somewhere safe and never show or tell anyone these words. Anyone who has this phrase can access your assets and do as they please with them, so don't ever give it to anyone!
